/**
 * Edge auth pre-filter.
 *
 * Runs on Vercel's Edge network (geographically near the user) BEFORE any
 * Node serverless function spins up. It is deliberately minimal and is NOT a
 * replacement for the real authentication check:
 *
 *   • Every authed page's Server Component still calls validateSession()
 *     (full `jsonwebtoken` verify + a MongoDB session check for
 *     sessionVersion / activeSessionId / active) in the Node runtime. That is
 *     and remains the single source of truth for access.
 *
 *   • This middleware only short-circuits requests that carry NO session
 *     cookie at all — logged-out users, bots, and crawlers hitting an authed
 *     route. They are redirected straight to /login at the edge, so they never
 *     start a Node function or open a database connection. At scale this keeps
 *     junk traffic off the Node/Mongo tier.
 *
 * Fail-open by design: if the cookie IS present we pass the request straight
 * through and let Node do the authoritative validation (which will redirect an
 * invalid/expired/deactivated session itself, exactly as before). We never
 * verify the signature here — no JWT secret touches the edge, and a forged
 * cookie gains nothing because Node still rejects it.
 *
 * The matcher is an explicit allow-list of the known authed route segments, so
 * public routes (/login, /forgot-password, the bootstrap flow, static assets,
 * API routes, and any public profile page) are never touched. When a NEW
 * top-level authed route is added, add its segment here too.
