/**
 * Login-screen wisdom — curated to what Pragati is actually for: doing the
 * work. Every line speaks to building, shipping, focus, finishing, resilience,
 * ownership, and reasoning from first principles — not wealth, career, or
 * self-help in the abstract.
 *
 * Source: Jensen Huang — founder and CEO of NVIDIA — drawn from his own
 * documented words: keynotes, interviews, and his commencement / university
 * addresses (Stanford GSB, Caltech, NTU), where the themes of mission,
 * resilience, suffering, intellectual honesty, and acting with conviction
 * recur most clearly.
 *
 * Honesty about sourcing: these are well-known, widely-circulated lines chosen
 * for how cleanly they map to the work. Some are condensed or paraphrased from
 * longer remarks. That is acceptable here for one specific reason, and only
 * this reason:
 *
 *   Display rule: NO attribution is EVER rendered. The login page shows the
 *   line, never the name or the source. `author` is kept on the type purely as
 *   an internal curation/grouping key and is never surfaced in the UI. So the
 *   words stand alone as anonymous wisdom; the screen never claims "X said this."
 *
 * No-repeat rule: the login page rotates through a per-device shuffled queue
 * and never repeats a quote until the whole library is exhausted. Each quote
 * also stays on screen for a length of time proportional to how long it takes
 * to read (see `readingMs` on the login page), so longer lines aren't cut off.
