/**
 * Pragati release history — the source of truth for the in-app Changelog page.
 *
 * Append a new entry at the TOP of `CHANGELOG` whenever a feature ships,
 * keeping the list in reverse-chronological order. The admin-only
 * /audit/changelog route renders directly off this array, so a code review
 * doubles as the release-notes review.
 *
 * Why a TS module instead of a CMS or markdown file: keeps the changelog
 * versioned alongside the code, gives type-safe references to the entry
 * shape, and ships with the bundle (no runtime fetch, no CDN).

Tolkien, Peter Thiel’s Zero to One) and the inventors and leaders he names as heroes (Nikola Tesla, Benjamin Franklin, Isaac Newton, Henry Ford, Richard Feynman, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Winston Churchill). Curated to what Pragati is for: building, shipping, focus, finishing, and deleting the unessential.',

    tags: ['fix', 'security'],
    body: [
      'The read-only demo accounts (whose password is published in the README) are now exempt from the brute-force lockout. Because the password is intentionally public, the lockout secured nothing for them and only handed any visitor a way to take the live demo down — five wrong passwords would lock the shared account until an admin cleared it by hand, and the lockout wall then refused even the correct, published password.',
      'Demo logins no longer accrue failed-attempt counts, so they can never lock; and a successful demo login now clears any lock an earlier visitor left behind, so the demo self-heals. Real accounts are unaffected — they keep the full five-attempt lockout. The demo-account pattern (demo.*@pragati.local) is now shared between the seed and the auth path so the two can never disagree.',

Same theme as before: lines that map to getting work shipped, not wealth or career in the abstract.',

      'Simplified the plumbing behind it: the optional live-feed system (a public API route, an in-memory cache, and the QUOTES_FEED_URL env var that let the quote library be swapped without a redeploy) has been deleted. The curated library now ships with the app and nothing else — fewer moving parts, one less public endpoint, same screen.',

Drawn from Naval Ravikant and the books he recommends (Munger, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Bruce Lee, James Clear, Feynman, Deutsch), keeping only the lines that speak to execution — not wealth or career in the abstract.',
      'Fixed the repeat: the page used to re-open on the same daily quote on every visit (and never record it as seen). It now advances to a line this device hasn’t shown yet and remembers it, so no quote returns until every other one has had its turn — and never two in a row.',

      'The time-simulation “HEAT %” is now a calibrated logistic slip-risk probability (engineered features → log-odds → sigmoid, the same model family as the slip-risk early warning) instead of an ad-hoc point sum — so the number is an interpretable probability, and advancing the +1d/+3d/+7d horizon genuinely re-forecasts each task’s chance of slipping rather than re-bucketing a counter.',
